A Unity Traffic Simulator.

This Unity game simulates traffic patterns specifically in intersections.

My current objective is to build an accurate simulation of cars traversing a stop sign intersection with two crossing perpendicular roads.
When that is complete, I will add traffic lights with cycles.
My goal is to use a recursive neural net to train these traffic lights and develop an adaptive cycle that limits idle time.
