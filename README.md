### Unity Traffic Sim

A modular traffic simulation system for optimizing real intersections.

I plan to use reinforcement learning through MLAgents and PyTorch to train optimized light controllers that
react to typical traffic patterns and density. These would reduce idle times and subsequently carbon emissions
if implemented IRL.
